# Towards sustainable development

An environmentally sustainable power sector is central to modern society since plants have significant impact on climate, through carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions; on water stress, through water withdrawal and consumption; and on air quality, through sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) emissions. 
Under the #ParisAgreement (since 2016) and the evidences on climate change, we engaged ourselves in reducing the level of CO2 emission. How much were we successful?
Here I performed analyses on the energy consumption/production in Europe; the datasets are publicly accessible in “our world in data” and “world resources institute” and contains the following characteristics and indicators:
•	All types of fuel
•	Technical characteristics (fuel, technology, ownership)
•	Plants’ geolocation
•	Energy production/consumption (per capita) around the globe since 1965
•	Annual change in primary energy consumption
